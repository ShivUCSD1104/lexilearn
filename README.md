As the World's first free large-text-to-storybook web application, Lexi Learn leverages cutting-edge generative AI to transform text into engaging visuals, enhancing comprehension & learning experiences effortlessly.

Reading is finally fun and exciting because it is no longer reading -- it's a whole new visual experience!!! 

Who can best understand problems faced by students but students themselves? 
Lexi Learn has been built by four university students who are venturing into the world of programming and are trying to solve some major societal issues.

With Lexi Learn, we aim to help anyone who wishes to enhance their English language comprehension.
If someone is struggling with English for whatever reason -- English is not their primary language, they may be suffering from reading/learning disabilities like ADHD or dyslexia, or they are unable to grasp English even after putting in a lot of effort -- then Lexi Learn is the way to go! 

All the user has to do is input any large PDF text file and click on generate -- our API framework uses generative AI to generate images for each portion of the text and enable visual comprehension.
We aim to make the user understand what they couldn't understand earlier by outputting the text side-by-side with context-relevant images. We use learning-disability-friendly fonts and colors.

While you scroll through your text we aid your understanding as you will not just easily understand but also easily remember the text, something different from the mainstream "rot-learning" methods.

We also have a vocabulary section where the user can store any words that they wish to learn the definitions and synonyms for. We have smartly used the technology of storing the data locally using cache so that they can refer to their vocabulary permanently without creating an account.
We as students know how big a task it is to learn new words and how complex words can be a hindrance to understanding texts. Another cool feature of Lexi Learn is our "Quiz" section where you can test all your vocabulary and put your learning to a test multiple times.

In the future, we aim to further improve the inclusivity of our platform through text-to-speech generation and foreign language translation. 
We also aim to add another Quiz section where the user can test their understanding of their input text. We also aim to implement Machine Learning in this part and give the user recommendations of educational resources. 
Additionally, we aim to provide an age-appropriate text-summarisation for texts soon.
Be on the lookout for our new features on our upcoming cool features that will only enhance user experience exponentially. 

We have created a strong backend in Python and Flask with a frontend in HTML and CSS to create our open-access web application.
